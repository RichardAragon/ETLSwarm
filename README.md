# ETL Swarm
ETL Swarm is a Python-based implementation designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data using a swarm of algorithms in conjunction with a language model (LLM) to automate data correction processes. This implementation demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to identify and correct issues within a dataset, and then update a SQLite database with the corrected data.

Overview
ETL Swarm is a proof-of-concept that leverages AI to automate the ETL process, particularly focusing on data correction. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to identify and suggest corrections for data issues. The workflow involves:

Extracting data from a source.
Identifying and correcting data issues.
Loading the corrected data back into the database.
Prerequisites
Before running ETL Swarm, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or higher
OpenAI API key
Installation

Follow these steps to run the ETL Swarm code in Google Colab or your local environment:

Install Required Libraries:

python
Copy code
!pip install openai pandas sqlalchemy dask
Initialize OpenAI API and Import Libraries:

python
Copy code
from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
Set OpenAI API Key:

python
Copy code
client = OpenAI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
Create Sample Data and Save to SQLite Database:

python
Copy code
# Sample data
data = {
    "ID": [1, 2, 3, None, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    "NAME": ["John Doe", "Prediction = \"Mary Smith\"", "Jim Brown", "Alex Johnson", "Alan Smithee", "LUCY BLACK", "Eve White", "Michael Taylor", "Sarah Green", "TIM BLUE"],
    "DATE": ["2023-07-01", "7/2/2023", "2023-07-03", "2023/07/04", "07-05-2023", "2023-07-06", "07/07/2023", "2023-07-08", "2023-07-09", "2023-07-10"],
    "AMOUNT": [150, 175, 200, 150.25, 200, 350.75, -20, None, 500.5, 50.75],
    "EMAIL": ["JOHN.DOE@EXAMPLE.COM", "MARY.SMITH@EXAMPLE.COM", "JIM.BROWN@EXAMPLE.COM", "NANCY@DOMAIN.COM", "ALAN.SMITHEE@DOMAIN", "Prediction = \"LUCY.BLACK@DOMAIN.COM\"", "EVE.WHITE@DOMAIN.COM", "MICHAEL.TAYLOR@EXAMPLE.COM", "sarah.green@example.com", ""]
}

Code Explanation
Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries.
Initialize OpenAI API: Set up the OpenAI client with your API key.
Create Sample Data: Create a sample DataFrame and save it to a SQLite database.
Define Functions:
map_data(): Extracts data from the database and identifies issues.
generate_correction_code(): Uses the LLM to generate Python code for correcting identified issues.
apply_corrections(): Applies the generated correction code to the DataFrame.
update_database(): Updates the database with the corrected data, ensuring no duplicate columns.
Run ETL Swarm: Executes the ETL process by identifying issues, generating corrections, applying those corrections, and updating the database.
